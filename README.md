###  Dot

Tiny tool to deal with configuration files (dot files).

#### Idea
This tool iterates over the current directory and creates symbolic links from ${HOME} to all files inside the current directory.  
If some files already exist than backup files will be created.  

#### Installation
1. Put the binary file into PATH
2. Use from any directory (from your git repository or any other folder)
